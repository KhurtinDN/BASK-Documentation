Behavioral Analytics Starter Kit
==============================
Are you looking for an advanced recommendation engine for your eCommerce platform? Нow much time you are willing to spend to see the first results?
Behavioral Analytics Starter Kit will deliver recommendations within half an hour!

“Behavior Analytics Starter Kit" is a perfect starting point for your eCommerce analytics. It provides the basic building blocks to perform behavior analytics tasks for eCommerce big data using Hadoop.
“Behavior Analytics Starter Kit" implements common use case of personalisation/behavior analytics in eCommerce domain area: recommend what items usually purchased together with selected item(s). And it is only subtask in wide recommendations related analytics area. 
“Behavior Analytics Start Kit" consists of two main blocks:
Analytic platform
Sample store (web UI)
Sample store contain product catalog, that is used to generate sample transaction log. You can run analytic application against transaction log to get recommendations and use it in the sample store.
You can modify variety of job parameters and source code, use your product catalog and even use sample of your real transaction log to generate recommendations. So, everybody: data analysts, hadoop deployment engineers, analytic job engineers will find interesting use cases here.




“Behavior Analytics Starter Kit" key features:
provide advanced recommendations for items groups.
recommendations dynamically updates after each change of shopping cart.
customisable scenario is used to generate Transaction Log.
product catalog, Transaction Log generator scenario configurations, settings of recommendation processor could be changed.



Are you interested in eCommerce platforms and its recommendation components? Maybe you are looking for an advanced recommendation engine for your eCommerce shopping cart? Then you probably know that recommendations often based on association rules. 
Association rule learning is well known method for discovering meaningful relations between items in huge Transaction Logs.

This process analyzes customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets” (see the picture). The discovery of such associations can help you develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers.
